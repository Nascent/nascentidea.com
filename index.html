          <p>I believe that a good idea is the foundation of a successful startup. But a good idea is hard to recognize so founders often waste a year or more pursuing an idea before giving up.</p>
          <p>To address this challenge, I created <b>Nascent</b> 🪺: the <a href="#faq-2">first <b>repeatable</b> methodology</a> for founders to quickly eliminate bad ideas and reveal startup ideas worth pursuing. </p>

      <h2>Nascent vs. conventional entrepreneurship</h2>

      </div>

      <p>This conventional approach assumes PMF is achievable and <strong>ignores the cost</strong> of trying to reach PMF.</p>

      <p>Many &ldquo;experts&rdquo; promise to get your startup to PMF. Nascent rejects this. Nobody can guarantee your startup will reach PMF &mdash; even experts who've gotten other startups to PMF can't guarantee the same for yours. Listen carefully and you'll hear about a handful of winners &mdash; and deafening silence about the founders who wasted a year or more pursuing a fruitless idea.</p>

      <p>Instead of promising PMF, Nascent promises clarity.</p>

      <h3>Nascent proposes a new goal for founders at <em>Pre-PMF</em>:</h3>

      </div>

      <p>A founder's top priority must be to decide quickly whether reaching PMF is doubtful or possible.</p>

      <p>Nascent helps founders quickly evaluate their chances of reaching PMF &mdash; and why. We believe that anyone who's ever been a customer of anything ever, started as a Person in Pain. Thus to evaluate a startup idea, Nascent shows founders how to search for People in Pain™ and to quantify the Pain in dollars ($).</p>

      <h3>The engagement</h3>

      <p>Mike embeds with your team to generate deliverables, then supports you as you decide whether PMF is possible or doubtful. Here's what to expect:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>We'll start with an in-person all-day on-site kickoff, including a case-study workshop where you'll roleplay a founder applying Nascent to her startup idea.</li>
        <li>We'll identify People to target for discovery interviews followed by outreach and scheduling. You'll take the lead, and Mike will be there to support you.</li>
        <li>We'll run a batch of at least five discovery interviews.</li>
        <li>Mike will analyze data from the interviews and generate deliverables.</li>
        <li>You'll use the deliverables to iterate and improve the idea or stop altogether.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>After the in-person kickoff, we'll collaborate via Zoom, Slack and additional in-person meetings.</p>

      <h3>What does the timeline look like?</h3>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Week 1:</strong> Kickoff, workshops and schedule interviews</li>
        <li><strong>Weeks 2-3:</strong> Two-week sprint to gather data in discovery interviews</li>
        <li><strong>Week 4:</strong> Analyze and decide</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Mike's goal is to get you to decisiveness within 30 days. The time-limiting step is the founder's ability to schedule interviews, which depends on the founder's network, budget and ability to hustle.</p>

      <p><strong>What if the founder reaches decisiveness before running interviews?</strong></p>

      <p>Some founders reach decisiveness during the methodology workshops alone (in Week 1). If that happens, the remaining three weeks of engagement carry forward as credit for a future idea (valid for 6 months).</p>

        <div class="faq-content">
          <p>Nascent is for when your startup is not on track to hit PMF. Whether you're evaluating a completely new idea or considering changes to your current approach, Nascent helps you get clarity. The methodology still works: run discovery interviews, gather and analyze the data in a novel way to determine whether PMF is possible or doubtful.</p>

      <h3 class="faq-category" id="faq-2">2. About Nascent</h3>

      <details id="faq-2-1">
        <summary>2.1 Is Nascent the only methodology for assessing whether PMF is doubtful?</summary>
        <div class="faq-content">
          <p>Yes. It's common for founders to waste a year or more pursuing a bad idea because conventional tools (Lean Startup, customer discovery, JTBD) don't address this challenge directly. The conventional advice is to "fail fast" &mdash; yes, but how?! No other entrepreneurship tools quantify the opportunity of a startup idea in dollars ($) using first-hand data (discovery interviews).</p>
          <p>While searching for strategies to identify and avoid pursuing bad startup ideas, Mike has read tens of books on entrepreneurship, listened to hundreds of podcasts and watched thousands of hours of video. None offered a solution. Mike has also met with scores of founders and dozens of entrepreneurial thought leaders but they also don't know of a compelling solution.</p>
          <p>The closest thing Mike has found is <a href="https://paulgraham.com/before.html?ref=nascentidea.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a lecture in 2014</a> by Paul Graham, founder of <a href="https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/pulling-back-the-curtain-on-the-magic">Y Combinator</a>. PG said that for him to identify a compelling startup idea: <em>"I seem to have some sort of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii1jcLg-eIQ&t=1610s&ref=nascentidea.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">internal compass</a> that helps me out."</em> Later in the lecture a student pushed for clarification but PG couldn't answer so instead he shouted <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii1jcLg-eIQ&t=2741s&ref=nascentidea.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"I don't know!</a> I don't know!"</em>.</p>
          <p>So what about the rest of us without PG's &ldquo;internal compass&rdquo;? Mike believes that Nascent methodology is that compass. The goal for 2026 is to create more case studies to prove it. As far as Mike knows, Nascent is the only methodology designed to allow founders to be decisive in days, in part because it leverages <a href="https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/loss-aversion?ref=nascentidea.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">behavioral economics</a> and includes a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krippendorff%27s_alpha?ref=nascentidea.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scientifically repeatable process</a> to analyze ground truth (interview transcripts).</p>
          <p>If you know of anyone else or any other methodologies focused on this challenge, please let Mike know at <a href="mailto:hello@nascentidea.com">hello@nascentidea.com</a>. Mike would love to connect and learn more.</p>

        <summary>2.2 How is Nascent different from Lean Startup and customer discovery?</summary>
        <div class="faq-content">
          <p><b>In short:</b> Nascent agrees with conventional Lean Startup and customer discovery that founders must <em>&ldquo;get out of the building&rdquo;</em> to learn. But Nascent rejects most of the conventional playbook: a pseudoscientific approach of &ldquo;validating hypotheses&rdquo; using self-reported data. The conventional approach misleads founders and often results in a year or more of wasted time.</p>
          <p><b>The details:</b> Back in the early 2000s, it was common for entrepreneurs to work in isolation for years on a product design only for no customers to purchase the product. So when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Blank?ref=nascentidea.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steve Blank</a> created customer discovery in 2005 (later formalized in the <a href="https://venturewell.org/wp-content/uploads/I-Corps-Teaching-Handbook-Jan16.pdf?ref=nascentidea.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I-Corps Teaching Handbook</a> and <a href="https://venturewell.org/wp-content/uploads/I-Corps-Faculty-Training-Wbk-January-2017_Web.pdf?ref=nascentidea.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Faculty Training Workbook</a>), he dramatically improved entrepreneurship. Nascent extends conventional customer discovery by addressing gaps, including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Nomenclature.</strong> Terms like "customer discovery" are inherently confusing. Too often founders lie to themselves and say they <em>"ran customer discovery interviews"</em> and they've <em>&ldquo;discovered customers&rdquo;</em> even though nobody ever paid their startup, i.e., there are no customers. Sloppy language fosters sloppy thinking. Nascent encourages founders of startups with no customers to avoid saying <em>"customers"</em>. Anyone who's ever been a customer began as a Person in Pain. So, Nascent reframes the goal of discovery interviews as <em>searching for People in Pain</em> who (with lots of luck) might someday become prospects and even customers.</li>
            <li><strong>Data quality.</strong> Conventional customer discovery accepts self-reported data, which is unacceptable in any other serious field. Nascent rejects self-reported data because it inherently contains errors. Nascent only uses recordings.</li>
            <li><strong>Data analysis.</strong> Conventional customer discovery has founders <em>"validate hypotheses"</em> without a repeatable process (<em>"you know it when you see it"</em> and <em>"looks right to me"</em> aren't repeatable). Moreover, the entire concept of &ldquo;validation&rdquo; is backwards: we can't validate truth, but we can eliminate errors, per <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Conjectures-Refutations-Scientific-Knowledge-Routledge/dp/0415285941?ref=nascentidea.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karl Popper</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Infinity-Explanations-Transform-World/dp/0143121359?ref=nascentidea.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">David Deutsch</a>. To that end, Nascent is very much about eliminating errors using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krippendorff%27s_alpha?ref=nascentidea.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scientifically measured</a> categorization framework. (Full disclosure: Nascent has yielded high repeatability, but only for the startup in the case study workshop. Mike is keen to run more tests.)</li>
            <li><strong>Actionable deliverable.</strong> Conventional customer discovery validates a business model over months or years. Focusing on the business model is too broad. Instead, Nascent focuses on the most common reason a startup fails: a lack of paying customers. Nascent generates a signal about the potential to generate revenue in days.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>2.3 What are the deliverables from Nascent that enable a founder to be decisive?</summary>
        <div class="faq-content">
          <p>The Nascent deliverables make sense to most founders after training in a 4-hour workshop. After the workshop, if you aren't interested in the deliverables then we offer a moneyback guarantee.</p>
          <p><strong>Quantified Pain Graph™</strong> &mdash; A data visualization that lets a founder instantly interpret the results from a batch of discovery interviews by measuring the interviewee's pain in dollars ($).</p>
          <p><strong>ERNY™ Value</strong> &mdash; Estimated Revenue Next Year (ERNY) from the ground up with no customers today only based on conversations with People in Pain. The ERNY value answers the question: <em>"Based on the problems interviewees articulated, how much revenue could this startup generate next year?"</em> Nascent methodology allows founders to determine ERNY with neither a product nor letters of intent (LOI) nor any kind of pre-sales &mdash; just an analysis of the interview transcript. A low ERNY value clarifies that PMF is doubtful.</p>
          <p><strong>Report on Learnings &amp; Opportunities</strong> &mdash; A structured summary of everything discovered during interviews, with every insight traceable to an exact timestamp in a recorded interview. No hand-waving, no &ldquo;we heard from customers that...&rdquo; &mdash; every value in the report points back to a specific moment in a specific conversation.</p>

        <summary>2.4 What has Nascent accomplished to date?</summary>
        <div class="faq-content">
          <p>In 2025, Mike taught Nascent to 150 founders across 20 workshops at Georgia Tech, Emory, the Technion and innovation hubs. The workshops demonstrated that Nascent could consistently enable founders to go from uncertainty to deciding quickly whether to continue or kill a startup idea.</p>
          <p>Specifically in the workshops, the founders walked through a case study where they played the role of a founder. At the start of the workshop, Mike challenged the founders to decide whether the idea was worth pursuing and why. The founders referenced conventional approaches (talk to customers, build an MVP, etc.) but couldn't reach a continue/kill decision. During the workshop the founders learned Nascent. At the end of the workshop the founders analyzed a <em>"Quantified Pain Graph"</em> and almost all were decisive. To be clear, they didn't all reach the same decision &mdash; some wanted to continue whereas others wanted to kill the idea. At Nascent, we measure success by the founder's time to decide because it drives massive cost savings for the startup.</p>
          <p>In addition to the workshops, Mike coached a cohort of four founders over ten weeks. The cohort confirmed that founders benefit most from high-touch, embedded support &mdash; which is what Mike now offers.</p>

      <details>
        <summary>2.5 Who decides whether PMF is possible or doubtful? Whether to continue or kill the startup?</summary>
        <div class="faq-content">
          <p>The founder decides. Nascent only cares that you're decisive quickly.</p>
          <p>Think of Nascent like the speedometer on your car. Nascent's deliverables reveal whether you're going 2 MPH or 200 MPH, so that you can decide whether you'll reach your destination on time.</p>

      <details>
        <summary>2.6 How does Nascent help startups get to PMF?</summary>
        <div class="faq-content">
          <p>Nascent rejects the premise of <em>"helping startups get to product-market fit"</em> because it ignores the <strong>cost</strong> of trying to reach PMF. Instead, Nascent helps founders determine quickly whether reaching PMF is possible or doubtful &mdash; and why. If you choose to continue building your startup, Nascent enables you to iterate and improve the idea.</p>

      <details>
        <summary>2.7 How does Nascent compare to guidance from an LLM like ChatGPT or Claude?</summary>
        <div class="faq-content">
          <p>LLMs provide conventional advice that delivers conventional outcomes, i.e., a year or more of wasted time. Since Nascent is novel, LLMs can't provide it.</p>

      <details>
        <summary>2.8 How does Nascent compare to hiring an expert in marketing or growth?</summary>
        <div class="faq-content">
          <p>Although there are many startup supporters and frameworks, Nascent is unique. Mike is the <a href="#faq-2-1">only expert</a> laser focused on this specific challenge: deciding quickly whether PMF is possible or doubtful, before you make a significant investment.</p>
          <p>Most fractional Chief Marketing Officers (CMOs) disclaim pre-PMF work entirely &mdash; they optimize after PMF, not before. Most growth experts (PMF coaches, GTM strategists) promise to help your startup reach PMF. This requires the founder to invest significant resources with no guarantee of reaching PMF. You should work with growth experts once you <em>disprove that PMF is doubtful</em> -- i.e., that PMF is possible. Until that point, there's a good chance you're wasting time and resources. The truth is that most startups do not achieve PMF (that's why PMF is special!). You should first have a real reason to believe PMF is possible, then move on to growth and marketing.</p>

        <summary>2.9 Can Mike run the interviews alone and just report back to the founder?</summary>
        <div class="faq-content">
          <p>Founders should expect to dedicate a meaningful amount of time to running interviews. You know the most about the field you're pursuing and you're the most curious about the interviewee and their problems. Mike will participate and support you, but the founder needs to take the lead.</p>

        <summary>2.10 Can we run Nascent on previously recorded interviews?</summary>
        <div class="faq-content">
          <p>Yes, it's fine to start with existing recordings. And you should expect to run additional interviews too.</p>

        <div class="faq-content">
          <ul>
            <li>Nascent is a general-purpose methodology that applies to any type of tech startup (B2B SaaS, cybersecurity, B2C, etc.).</li>
            <li>Nascent enables decisiveness in days, not years. The limiting factor is how quickly the founder runs discovery interviews.</li>

          <p>We can support your next steps:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Iterate.</strong> Change your approach &mdash; target different People in Pain or run another batch of discovery interviews to see if the signal improves.</li>
            <li><strong>Start fresh.</strong> Brainstorm a new idea and apply Nascent again. Now that you know what you're looking for to get a "PMF is possible", you'll develop better ideas.</li>

      <h2>About Mike</h2>

      <div class="about-grid">
        <div class="about-text">
          <h3>Who is Mike Vladimer and why did he create Nascent?</h3>
          <p>Mike created Nascent for founders of startups with NO CUSTOMERS, to navigate decisions with minimal data.</p>
          <p>Mike believes that startups with customers face different challenges than startups with NO CUSTOMERS. But conventional startup strategy doesn't make this distinction. There is no <em>&ldquo;Playbook 1: For startups with customers&rdquo;</em> and <em>&ldquo;Playbook 2: For startups with no customers&rdquo;</em>. Consequently, founders take strategies for startups with customers (e.g., Build-Measure-Learn) and shoehorn them into their startup with no customers, usually with tragic results &mdash; founders wasting a year or more. Mike created Nascent as the playbook for founders of startups with no customers.</p>
          <p>Over the last 20 years, Mike has mentored hundreds of founders, co-created ten startups and worked in three corporate innovation labs, specializing in new product development. Mike earned an MBA from UC Berkeley Haas School of Business and an MS Electrical Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University.</p>

      <div class="mike-story">
        <h3>How Lean Startup failed Mike and sparked Nascent</h3>
        <p>At Berkeley in 2013, I was lucky to attend the Lean Launchpad class run by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Blank?ref=nascentidea.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steve Blank</a> and <a href="https://haas.berkeley.edu/faculty/engel-jerome/?ref=nascentidea.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jerry Engel</a>. In this class, the professors kept telling me <em>"Your startup idea sucks"</em> but they couldn't explain why. And because I didn't understand why, I pursued my startup idea throughout business school. At graduation, all of my classmates had job offers, while I had a dead startup and no money in the bank. This was one of the lowest points in my life &mdash; the crisis that prompted me to create Nascent. I wish I had had a structured, data-driven reason for what constitutes an opportunity worth pursuing. I know how painful it is to invest years only to run a startup into the ground. Founders are rare, creative people with a unique capacity to meaningfully improve the world &mdash; your time is too valuable to waste on a bad idea. I want you to avoid my fate.</p>
